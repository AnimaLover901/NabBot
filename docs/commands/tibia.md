## /whois *playerName/discordUser*
*Other aliases: /check, /player, /checkplayer, /char, /character*

This commands has 2 functions:  

* It retrieves and displays info about a Tibia character
* It retrieves the list of characters linked to a discord user

If the parameter matches a discord user, it displays a list of the characters linked to that user.
If the parameter matches a character, it will display the character's info, such as level, vocation, guild, world, etc.

If the character found is registered to a discord user, it will show the owner of the character.

Both cases can match simultaneously.
