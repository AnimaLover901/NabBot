## /whois *playerName/discordUser*
*Other aliases: /check, /player, /checkplayer, /char, /character*

This commands has 2 functions:  

* It retrieves and displays info about a Tibia character
* It retrieves the list of characters linked to a discord user

If the parameter matches a discord user, it displays a list of the characters linked to that user.
If the parameter matches a character, it will display the character's info, such as level, vocation, guild, world, etc.

If the character found is registered to a discord user, it will show the owner of the character.

Discord users can be looked for through Usernames, User#Discriminator (i.e. `Galarzaa#8515`) or even user id.

Both cases can match simultaneously.

It also shows the character's corresponding highscore positions, however, this is only available for registered characters.
